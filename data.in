As shown in Table 3, our model achieves better performance in opinion words
extraction. Although our sentiment classification accuracy is a little worsen than
SA-LSTM-P, it significantly improves result of opinion words extraction.
4.4 Case studies
To further show the advantages of our model, we visualize some examples from
test data. As we can see from the first example in Figure 3(a), the model suc-
cessfully extracts opinion words in the sentence and distinguishes influence of
different opinion words towards different aspects for sentiment polarity classi-
fication. Second example in Figure 3(b) shows that when no explicit opinion
word for aspect, model captures semantic information from context and classify
correctly.
And we also analyze error. Model misunderstands latent sentiment occurring
in sentences. It seems difficult to recognize the sentiment in sentences without
obvious or usual expression in Figure 3(c) and Figure 3(d).
5 Conclusion
In this work, we propose a hierarchical model of reviews for joint aspect-level
sentiment classification and word-level opinion extraction. The key idea is to
learn semantic information from two level LSTMs for opinion word extraction
and sentiment classification respectively. Experiments on two datasets verify
that the proposed approach achieves a comparable result in sentiment polarity
classification and makes a significant improvement in extraction at word level.
